## Prerequisites

After a quick [Development Environment Setup](SETUP.md), you're ready to select a tutorial from the list below.

## [Hellochain](./hellochain/tutorial/00-intro.md)

This is the quick and simple "Hello World" introduction to building with the Cosmos SDK. You will build a fully-funcitonal blockchain with payment functionality and a custom "greeter" module. This tutorial makes use of the `utils/starter` package to reduce boilerplate and allow you to focus on the core concepts. Start here if you are evaluating Cosmos as your possible platform of choice.

## [Nameservice](./nameservice/tutorial/00-intro.md)

The real deal, full-length tutorial in which you will build a fully functional naming service on a blockchain. This tutorial does not use the `starter` package, rather you will be configuring and composing a full application yourself.
The nameservice tutorial also has translations and a slide deck.

## [Scavenge](./scavenge/tutorial/01-background.md)

A scavenger hunt of sorts! Users post questions with hashed answers and bounties for whoever can solve them using a commit-reveal scheme that prevents front-running.
